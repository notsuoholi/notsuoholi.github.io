I am a driven professional constantly trying to find new ways to improve. I understand that a person can only grow when they take time to water themselves. When one pours effort and time into the things that bring them joy and a sense of pride, the result is often seen, felt, and heard by others.

My hope is that this simple blog will inspire others to begin that journey for themselves. Here is where I will showcase all the things I am working on, the things that bring me joy, the things that make me better.

## My Projects

- [Healthchecker](https://github.com/notsuoholi/healthchecker): A simple script that performs health checks when provided a list of URLs defined in a YAML configuration file.
