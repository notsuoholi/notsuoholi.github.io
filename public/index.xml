      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have outlined a few of the core responsibilities and practices of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). Their focus is primarily on operational resilience and reducing toil through automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to cover key topics like system reliability, incident management, the importance of metrics like SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs, and how SREs use monitoring and alerting to maintain service performance while collaborating closely with development teams to ensure scalable, predictable, and efficient systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The below serves to outline some of the key aspects of DevOps and Release Engineering. It is not at all a complete guide but does cover some of the most important components. I will add to is as I continue to dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A focus on continuous delivery and automation in the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Champion guidelines, practices, and culture that aims  to break down the silos which traditionally separate development, operations, networking, and security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-background&#34;&gt;My Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Site Reliability Engineer with over five years of experience. I have a proven track record of transforming cloud infrastructure, ensuring system reliability, and reducing infrastructure costs. I crave a challenging environment where I can think out of the box and employ new techniques to solve difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a driven professional constantly trying to find new ways to improve. I understand that a person can only grow when they take time to water themselves. When one pours effort and time into the things that bring them joy and a sense of pride, the result is often seen, felt, and heard by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this simple blog will inspire others to begin that journey for themselves. Here is where I will showcase all the things I am working on, the things that bring me joy, the things that make me better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
